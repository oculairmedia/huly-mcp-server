# HULLY-107: Rework Transport Abstraction

## Summary

Successfully reworked the transport abstraction layer to integrate with the refactored codebase. This provides a clean separation between transport mechanisms (stdio/HTTP) and the core MCP protocol logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Transport Layer Structure
- **BaseTransport.js**: Abstract base class defining the transport interface
- **StdioTransport.js**: Standard I/O transport implementation
- **HttpTransport.js**: HTTP/Express transport implementation  
- **TransportFactory.js**: Factory for creating transport instances
- **index.js**: Central export point

### 2. BaseTransport Abstract Class
- Defines contract all transports must implement
- Methods: `start()`, `stop()`, `getType()`, `isRunning()`
- Cannot be instantiated directly
- Provides consistent interface across transport types

### 3. StdioTransport Implementation
- Wraps MCP SDK's StdioServerTransport
- Handles stdin/stdout communication
- No console logging (would interfere with protocol)
- Clean start/stop lifecycle management

### 4. HttpTransport Implementation
- Express-based HTTP server
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /health` - Health check with uptime
  - `POST /mcp` - JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for MCP protocol
  - `GET /tools` - List available tools
  - `POST /tools/:toolName` - REST-style tool execution
- Proper error handling with HulyError integration
- Configurable port via options or PORT env var

### 5. TransportFactory
- Creates transport instances based on type
- Supports 'stdio' and 'http' (case-insensitive)
- Validates transport types
- Passes options to transport constructors

### 6. Updated index.js
- Simplified main server class
- Uses TransportFactory to create appropriate transport
- Proper cleanup handling for graceful shutdown
- Command-line argument parsing for transport type
- Only logs for HTTP transport (stdio must be silent)

## Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Transport logic is completely separated from business logic
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new transport types (WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)
3. **Testability**: Each transport can be tested independently
4. **Consistency**: All transports follow the same interface
5. **Reusability**: Transport layer can be used by other MCP servers

## Usage

```bash
# Start with stdio transport (default)
node index.js

# Start with HTTP transport
node index.js --transport=http

# Start with HTTP on custom port
PORT=4567 node index.js --transport=http
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive unit tests:
- BaseTransport abstract class behavior
- TransportFactory creation and validation
- All tests passing (30 tests total)

## Next Steps

The transport abstraction is now complete and integrated. This provides a solid foundation for:
- Adding WebSocket transport for real-time communication
- Implementing transport-specific configuration
- Adding transport metrics and monitoring
