- Added validators for identifiers, priorities, dates, etc.
- Integrated validators into services

## Branches with Merge Conflicts

### 1. HULLY-102: Create Transport Abstraction Layer ❌
- Conflicts with current index.js structure
- Transport abstraction may need rework due to already merged changes

### 2. HULLY-104: Create Configuration Manager ❌
- Conflicts with index.js and constants.js
- Configuration management approach may need adjustment

### 3. HULLY-105: Create Logger Module ❌
- Would need selective cherry-picking
- Logger implementation included validation utilities

## Current State

The main branch now has:
- ✅ Core infrastructure (error handling, client wrapper, text utilities)
- ✅ Service layer extraction (project and issue services)
- ✅ Protocol layer separation (MCP handler and tool definitions)
- ✅ Validation utilities from MILESTONE 4

## Next Steps

1. **Push current changes** - The main branch has significant improvements that should be pushed
2. **Evaluate conflicted branches** - Determine if HULLY-102, 104, and 105 need to be reworked
3. **Final integration testing** - Test the refactored codebase thoroughly
4. **Documentation updates** - Update README and documentation for the new structure

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Modular Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
2. **Reusable Components** - Services, utilities, and core modules can be reused
3. **Better Error Handling** - Centralized error management with HulyError
4. **Improved Maintainability** - Smaller, focused modules
5. **Enhanced Testing** - Each module has its own test suite
6. **Type Safety** - Better validation throughout the codebase
